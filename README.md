# what-to-do
What To Do is a web app that can help people make&amp;manage their notes easier


# BLOCK OF 1.1.5 VERSION

# Stack of technologies used here:

  **Frontend:**
1.  HTML5
2.  CSS3
3.  JavaScript

  **Backend**
1. Python
2. Django 4.0.5
3. JavaScript(JQuery for get/post requests to the server)


# What is ready?

1. First design for welcome page, reg/login pages and user's cabinet( *without adaptation to small-screen devices* ).
2. System of registration/authorization for users.(it works on django's orm with sqlite)
3. The biggest part of cabinet functions is ready now. It includes: adding/deleting/editing notes; each-note buttons, like edit-note button, mark-note-as-important button, delete-note button and archive-note button; all of filters are ready - filter-by-creating-date, filter-by-date-to-finish, filter-by-important-notes, filter-by-archived-notes, filter-by-outdated-notes; user can also change his account info, like email and password.

# What is on developing?

1. System of checkboxes. Checkboxes - is a system that gives to user an oportunity to include inside of his note five additional items to extend this note. Functionally it work well, but it looks terrible :( So u can even use it now, but do not expect the best design itw.
2. Adaptive design for small-screen devices. I have not much expirience in how to adapt designs to small-screen devices, so it's not done now.. Yep, it is what it is.

# Which languages are supporting?

At this moment, on 1.1.5 version, it supports only Russian language.
